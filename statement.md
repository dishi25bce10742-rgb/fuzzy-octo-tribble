Problem Statement:- Many people struggle to decide what to wear for a specific occasion while staying within a fixed budget and choosing outfits that suit their body shape. This project aims to reduce decision fatigue by automatically recommending suitable outfit combinations based on user inputs.​

Scope of the Project:- The system focuses on recommending outfits using simple rule-based logic (no advanced machine learning).​

Inputs include budget, occasion, and body shape; outputs are textual suggestions of outfit types (e.g., “A-line dress with fitted waist” or “Dark jeans with structured blazer”).​

The current version runs in a terminal/console and is intended as a prototype; future versions could include a GUI or web interface.​

Target Users:- College students and young professionals who want quick outfit ideas without hiring a stylist.​

Users with a fixed budget looking for guidance on what types of clothing to buy or wear for events.​

Beginners who prefer a simple, text-based tool instead of complex fashion apps.​

High-level Features:- Input collection: Ask the user for budget, occasion, and body shape.​

Rule-based recommendation engine: Match user inputs to a set of predefined outfit rules (e.g., specific cuts and styles for each body shape and occasion).​

Budget filtering: Ensure that suggested outfit combinations respect the user’s maximum budget category (e.g., low/medium/high).​

Basic validation and feedback: Handle invalid or missing inputs and provide clear messages to the user.
